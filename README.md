# PokerCalculator
A calculator for pot odds and win odds in Texas Hold'em.


For use with the Ignition Poker client, the calculator takes screenshots of the cards in play and bet amounts.
Template matching is used with the screenshots to determine which cards are in play and what the bet amounts are.
The inputs can also be manually entered.

Dependencies:
The BoofCV library is required for template matching. The library can be downloaded at https://boofcv.org/index.php?title=Download.
